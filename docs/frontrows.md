###Frontrows
---

Frontrows are our silver portable speakers/microphones - there are 2 speakers, 1 microphone and a "behind the neck" microphone/trasmitter.

Once turned on, the microphone should link up automatically to the speakers.

The speakers have built-in batteries, but no idea on how much capacity they have left.


To play audio from a phone/computer, connect a 3.5 mm jack to the audio in, and you can daisychain another cable going from the audio out to the second speaker
